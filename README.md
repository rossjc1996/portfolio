all programs that I have worked on and saved on my personal computer.

KnightMoves and TriangleNumbers was a JAVA program I worked on in my Data Structures class. 

Frequency, ListInvariant, ListNode, TreeInvariant, TreeNode, and WordNode was the midterm for Data Structures. 

The C/C++ files are a Y-86 simulator that myself and a lab partner completed.
